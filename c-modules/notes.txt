All of the functions use to derive the distance parameter files are in functions called "def print_distances..."

I threw in the bclxl files for good meaure.

First you need to put the cpp file in a directory and compile it:

g++-4.6 rmsd_comp.cpp -o rmsd_comp.out

Then to run statium, just do this:

./build_test.py -build_statium_cpp path_to_directory_containing_.res_and_.pdb path_to_rmsd_comp.out

eg.:

./build_test.py -build_statium_cpp /home/bartolo/web/benchmarkC/new_src/thresh4/mcl1_3pk1 /home/bartolo/web/benchmarkC/new_src/CPP/rmsd/rmsd_comp.out

where /home/bartolo/web/benchmarkC/new_src/thresh4 contains mcl1_3pk1.pdb and mcl1_3pk1.res
