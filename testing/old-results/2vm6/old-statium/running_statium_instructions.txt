To unpack it, put it in coyote and run:
tar -xvzf test.tar.gz

You will see that the contents are:
test/bfl1_2vm6.pdb
test/2VM6.pdb
test/bfl1_2vm6.cfg
test/build_test.py
test/bfl1_2vm6.res

2VM6.pdb is a PDB file of Bfl-1 interacting with a Bim peptide. What statium aims to model is which amino acids fit into the peptide sequence.

The first step is to format the pdb file. To do that I took 2VM6 and ran:
./build_test.py -renumber test/2VM6.pdb test/bfl1_2vm6.pdb

This reformats the chain so that statium can read it.

Next, in a file test/bfl1_2vm6.res I listed numerically the position numbers of the peptide residues in the reformatted file.
Finally, you can just run the command ./build_test.py -build_statium test/bfl1_2vm6

Please try to repeat this and take a look at the final file outputs in test/bfl1_2vm6. Figure out as much a possible what is going on and then come see me. Email me if you have any problems.

BTW: Building statium takes some time (A few hours at least). You can run:

screen ./build_test.py -build_statium etc...

This will send the process to the background so that you can close the terminal while its running.
